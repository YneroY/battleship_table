# battleship_table
A minor project involving the design of a small-scale battleship grid using Windows form. PictureBox is used as individual block to build a 3 x 3 grid.
There are two ships that have been included (destroyer - 2 blocks, spy - 1 block). Each ship is represented by a different color. Using mouse, you
could left click to pickup/drop a ship, or right click to rotate.

It could be helpful if you need to create a grid and move objects in the grid.

#Future update
Might add some illustration to indicate when a ship is selected and moved around the grid. Any feedback is appreciated.
